# Spritz Native Launch — Build Log

What actually shipped per slice, what deviated from the plan and why, and anything learned that changes later slices.

**Format:** `## Slice <n> — <name>` then Closed, Shipped, Deviations, Learned, Affects.

## Slice 0 — Map approved

- **Closed:** 2026-08-29
- **Shipped:** `docs/build/launch-one-pager.md`, `docs/build/build-map.md`, `docs/build/decisions.md`, this log.
- **Deviations:** None. `APP_STORE_LAUNCH.md` from July 21 is retained as the step-by-step runbook but is superseded by the one-pager wherever they disagree. Corrections are listed under "What changed since the July 21 runbook."
- **Learned:** The July runbook was silent on in-app account deletion, Play's closed-testing requirement, privacy manifests, and the Xcode 26 SDK floor. Any store rule older than about a month needs re-verification against primary sources before it is planned around.
- **Affects:** Added slice 4 (account deletion) and slice 3 (tester clock), neither of which existed in the runbook.
